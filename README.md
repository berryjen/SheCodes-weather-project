# SheCodes-weather-project
live weather app
Self-reflection:
I found this project to be fun and a good instrument to implement the skillset i've learned thus far from the bootcamp. The JS part was by far the most challenging for me, as on several occassions i have lost track of the variables created, referring back and forth to the HTML to check i have the correct ID/class, incorporating the correct API and finaly the forecast. A lot of steep learning curves had to be overcome but I was glad that i was able to challenge myself and pushing my limits. 
As an improvement, it would be fun to link weather-related songs to the state of current weather. Ex) rainy weahter- purple rain; storm/thunderstorm- it's raining man; sunny-i'm walking on sunshine etc
