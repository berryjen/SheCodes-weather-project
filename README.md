# SheCodes-weather-project
live weather app
Self-reflection:
I found this project to be fun and a good instrument to implement the skillset i've learned thus far from the bootcamp. The JS part was by far the most challenging for me, as on several occassions i have lost track of the variables created, referring back and forth to the HTML to check i have the correct ID/class, incorporating the correct API and finaly the forecast. A lot of steep learning curves had to be overcome but I was glad that i was able to challenge myself and pushing my limits. 
As an improvement, it would be fun to link weather-related songs to the state of current weather. Ex) rainy weahter- purple rain; storm/thunderstorm- it's raining man; sunny-i'm walking on sunshine etc using external API such as spotify.
There was a lot of trouble finding the correct music streaming source without having to use o-auth as both Spotify and YouTube require that process. Deezer came across as a simple and free of charge openly-sourced music streaming service where i was able to find the music track ID and use that along with its documentation for embedding into my weather search engine
Incorporated regular expression for song-weather condition mapping. 
to fix the autoplay bug, i discovered that users have to manually allow autoplay by clicking on the tab at the beginning of the address bar, changing the setting to allow autoplay (as the default is set to block the autoplay feature)
